# Twitter-X-Impression-Regression
In this project, we'll be looking at 3 different Twitter users and their Tweets, the three being Chris Udalla, Elon Musk, and "Corn". The point of this project is to create a regression model for the views or interactions of a tweet. In each of our datasets, we will have 4 independent variables (favorites, retweets, replies, and media type).
